### K-Means:

K-Means is a type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm that consists of a partitioning method. This partitioning method works by dividing the dataset into "K clusters", wherein every data point belongs to an assigned cluster with the nearest mean. This will result in minimal numbers of squared distances in between data points and their respective cluster centroids. An advantage of this algorithm is that it is very efficient for larger datasets and works very well when clusters are equally sized. However, the disadvantage of this algorithm is that they always assume that the clusters are equally sized, making it an inefficient choicec for datasets which goes against that assumption.
